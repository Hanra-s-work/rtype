# Advanced Topics: Networking, Performance, and Reliability

This document discusses advanced techniques to improve network communication and engine performance.

## Data Packing and Compression

- Use smaller data types for network messages.
- Implement efficient serialization (e.g., RLE or LZ4) to reduce bandwidth.

## UDP Reliability

- Implement an acknowledgement (ACK) mechanism for critical messages.
- Use packet duplication and reordering techniques as needed.

## Synchronization and Prediction

- Implement **client-side prediction** to compensate for latency.
- Use **reconciliation** to correct state differences between client and server.
- Monitor latency and display metrics (FPS, lag, etc.) for debugging.

## Profiling and Debug Tools

- Integrate an in-game developer console for on-the-fly commands.
- Display in-game statistics (CPU usage, memory, entity count, etc.).
